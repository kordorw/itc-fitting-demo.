This repository contains a non-proprietary example of my Python/Jupyter workflow for analyzing calorimetry-type data. The notebook demonstrates how to import experimental data, perform nonlinear curve fitting, and generate publication-quality plots. All data included here are dummy values and do not reflect any confidential or unpublished research.

Contents

ITC_Fitting_Demo.ipynb – Jupyter notebook showing the workflow

dummy_itc_data.csv – Example dataset with synthetic values

Features

Reads calorimetry-like data from CSV

Performs nonlinear regression with parameter constraints using scipy.optimize

Calculates binding/thermodynamic parameters from fitted curves

Produces high-quality plots with matplotlib

Requirements

Python 3.x with:
numpy
pandas
scipy
matplotlib
How to Run

Clone or download the repository.

Install the required packages (pip install -r requirements.txt or individually).

Open the notebook in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.
